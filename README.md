# Data-Visualization
Python - Data visualization

I visualise the Canadian Immigration Data over the past few decades using Python pandas library.
Dataset Source: International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision.

The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international immigrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals. The current version presents data pertaining to 45 countries.

In this project, I will focus on the Canadian immigration data.
